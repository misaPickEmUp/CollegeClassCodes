/*

 Requirements

 Your game must include:


 At least three major decision
 points where the player must choose between two or more options

 At least two different possible endings,
 depending on the choices the player makes
 Navigation or Choices

 Allow the player to move through a few "rooms" or areas (e.g., forest → cave → treasure room)
 OR make decisions that branch the story (e.g., trust a character or not, explore vs hide)
 Object Interaction or Score Tracking (Optional)

 Introduce a very simple inventory item (e.g., a key, flashlight) or score system
 Track if the player "wins" based on collecting something or reaching a certain score
 Text-based UI

 All interactions happen via printed text and user input (no graphics necessary)


 Basic Code Structure

 Use variables to store decisions or track score
 Organize your code for readability (functions encouraged but not required)
 Add a map or visual ASCII art
 Create a save/load feature
 Implement a loop that allows the user to play again
 Add random events using a random number generator


 Submission Instructions

 Submit the following:

 Your completed .cpp file.

 ----------------------------------------------
 Overview

 In this assignment, you will design and implement a simple text-based adventure game. The goal is to create an interactive story where the user makes choices that influence the direction and outcome of the game. The setting can be anything you like — a haunted house, a fantasy world, a science lab, or even a day in the life of a student. The important part is that player decisions matter and lead to different paths and outcomes.
